# 🛡️ SOC-LAB-002 – Wazuh Dashboard Navigation & Event Investigation

> Learning how to navigate the Wazuh Dashboard, investigate security events and analyze event details using the Threat Hunting module.

---

# 📌 Overview

This laboratory focuses on the operational use of the Wazuh Dashboard after the successful deployment completed in SOC-LAB-001.

The objective is to understand how security analysts navigate the platform, investigate events, filter security logs and inspect event details.

---

# 🎯 Objective

Develop practical skills in navigating the Wazuh Dashboard and performing basic event investigations using the Threat Hunting module.

---

# 🏗️ Dashboard Components

During this lab the following Wazuh modules were explored:

- Dashboard Overview
- Endpoint Summary
- Threat Hunting Dashboard
- Events
- Search & Filters
- Document Details (Table)
- Document Details (JSON)

---

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Wazuh Dashboard | Security Monitoring |
| Wazuh Manager | Event Processing |
| Wazuh Agent | Endpoint Monitoring |
| Windows 11 | Monitored Endpoint |
| Docker | Wazuh Deployment |
| Ubuntu Linux | Host Operating System |

# 📊 Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard Overview](dashboard-overview.png)

### Evidence

The Dashboard provides a high-level overview of the monitored environment, including active agents, alert severity distribution and available security modules.

---

# 💻 Endpoint Summary

![Endpoint Summary](endpoint-summary.png)

### Evidence

The Endpoint Summary displays detailed information about the monitored Windows endpoint, including inventory, compliance, vulnerabilities, MITRE ATT&CK mapping and security posture.

---

# 🔎 Threat Hunting Dashboard

![Threat Hunting Dashboard](threat-hunting-dashboard.png)

### Evidence

The Threat Hunting dashboard provides visibility into alert trends, event severity and rule groups, allowing analysts to quickly assess security activity.

---

# 📑 Events View

![Events](events-view.png)

### Evidence

The Events page lists every security event collected by the Wazuh platform.

Each event includes:

- Timestamp
- Rule ID
- Rule Level
- Agent
- Description

This view represents the primary investigation interface used by SOC analysts.

---

# 🔍 Search & Filters

![Search Filters](search-filters.png)

### Evidence

Security analysts rarely inspect every event individually.

Instead, filters are applied to quickly locate relevant information.

Examples explored during this lab:

- Filter by Agent Name
- Filter by Rule Level
- Filter by Rule ID
- Filter by Rule Description

---

# 📄 Event Details (Table)

![Event Details Table](event-details-table.png)

### Evidence

Selecting an event opens the structured Table view, where analysts can inspect:

- Agent
- Manager
- Rule ID
- Rule Level
- Decoder
- Event ID
- Timestamp
- Description

---

# 🧾 Event Details (JSON)

![Event Details JSON](event-details-json.png)

### Evidence

The JSON view exposes the complete raw event collected by Wazuh.

Important fields analyzed during this laboratory:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| agent | Endpoint that generated the event |
| manager | Wazuh Manager |
| eventID | Native Windows Event ID |
| rule.id | Wazuh Detection Rule |
| rule.level | Alert Severity |
| decoder | Parser used by Wazuh |
| message | Original Windows Event |
| timestamp | Event Time |

The JSON view is one of the most valuable resources during security investigations.

# ⚠️ Investigation Example

During this laboratory, Windows Security Event **5061** was analyzed.

Key observations:

- Cryptographic Operation
- User: **yukem**
- Provider: Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider
- Rule ID: **60104**
- Rule Level: **5**
- Severity: **AUDIT_FAILURE**

The analysis demonstrated how raw Windows events are normalized and enriched by Wazuh before becoming searchable security alerts.
