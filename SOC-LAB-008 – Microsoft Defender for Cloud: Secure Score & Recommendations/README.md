# 📷 Lab Evidence

## 1. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview

![Overview](overview.png)

The Overview dashboard provides a centralized view of the Azure security posture, displaying assessed resources, Secure Score, attack paths, security alerts, and compliance status.

**Current Environment**

- Azure Subscriptions: **1**
- Assessed Resources: **4**
- Attack Paths: **0**
- Security Alerts: **0**

---

## 2. Security Posture (Secure Score)

![Security Posture](security-posture.png)

The Security Posture dashboard evaluates the overall security posture of the Azure environment.

**Current Secure Score**

- Secure Score: **25%**
- Critical Recommendations: **0**
- Attack Paths: **0**
- Recommendations Identified: **16**

This baseline will be used to measure future security improvements throughout the Azure Security Labs.

---

## 3. Environment Settings

![Environment Settings](environment-settings.png)

Environment Settings centralizes Defender for Cloud configuration for the Azure subscription.

From this section it is possible to manage:

- Governance Rules
- Data Sensitivity
- Integrations
- Security Rules
- Resource Criticality
- Direct Onboarding

---

## 4. Defender Plans

![Defender Plans](defender-plans.png)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud separates its capabilities into two categories:

### Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

- ✅ Foundational CSPM (Free)
- ❌ Defender CSPM (Disabled)

### Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP)

The following protection plans remained disabled during this lab:

- Servers
- App Service
- Databases
- Storage
- Containers
- AI Services
- Key Vault
- Resource Manager
- APIs

Premium plans were intentionally left disabled to keep the laboratory within the available Azure budget.

---

## 5. Security Recommendations

![Recommendations](recommendations.png)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatically generated several security recommendations for the environment.

Examples identified during this assessment include:

- Restrict network security group ports
- Enable Azure Backup for Virtual Machines
- Configure Security Contacts
- Install Guest Configuration Extension
- Install Vulnerability Assessment Solution
- Close Management Ports
- Enable Azure Disk Encryption

These recommendations will be implemented during future Azure Security Labs.

---

## 6. Regulatory Compliance

![Regulatory Compliance](regulatory-compliance.png)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud evaluates Azure resources against security frameworks.

Current assessment:

**Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark**

**Compliance Status**

- 49 of 63 controls passed

This compliance baseline will be used to measure future improvements after implementing additional security controls.

---

## 7. Resource Inventory

![Inventory](inventory.png)

The Inventory dashboard automatically discovered all Azure resources currently deployed in the subscription.

Resources identified:

- SOC-LAB005-VM
- LAW-SOC-LABS
- Virtual Network
- Subnet
- Azure Subscription

This inventory enables Microsoft Defender for Cloud to continuously monitor the security posture of each resource.

---

# 📚 Lessons Learned

During this lab, I learned how Microsoft Defender for Cloud evaluates Azure resources, calculates the Secure Score, identifies security recommendations, and measures compliance against Microsoft's security benchmark. I also explored Defender Plans and understood the distinction between free posture management capabilities and premium workload protection features.
